# Procedures for setting up and using Github at NOAA

Git (the software) and Github (the remote server) have become the preferred version control and collaboration tool for maintaining code
and developing software.  The main advantage is you will never be faced with a sprawling project directory with files 

## Setting up an account
The account you use for NOAA work will have to be different from your personal account.  To set up a NOAA account follow these steps:
* Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/)
* Create a new account using your NOAA email address
* Your user name should follow the template "FirstnameLastname-NOAA"
* Once your account is created, upload of photo of you as your profile photo
* Set up 2-factor authentication under your user settings

## Installing Git on Windows

## Using Git Bash
The command line interface is the preferred method to use github.  Unfortunately Windows doens't have a Bash terminal, 
so Git has included one in your Windows install.

To open Git Bash

## Rules for NOAA users
As NOAA users we are bound by a few rules:
* Your account must have a photo of you as your profile photo
* You must use 2-factor authentication
* You can only have NOAA related work under your account
* You can only contribute to NOAA affiliated repositories using your user name.
* Collaborators outside of NOAA can not directly commit changes to NOAA repositories.  Instead they will have to go through pull requests.
* Project repositories should be backed up on a system inside the NOAA firewall (for example zip download the master to your local work computer).
* README.md must have a disclaimer mentioned in NOAA Github Checklist (see below)
* License must have specific wording mentioned in NOAA Github Checklist
