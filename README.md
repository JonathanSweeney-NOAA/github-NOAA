# Procedures for setting up and using Github at NOAA

Git (the software) and Github (the remote server) have become the preferred version control and collaboration tool for maintaining code
and developing software.  The main advantage is you will never be faced with a sprawling project directory with files 

## Setting up an account
The account you use for NOAA work will have to be different from your personal account.  To set up a NOAA account follow these steps:
* Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/)
* Create a new account using your NOAA email address.
* Your user name should follow the template "FirstnameLastname-NOAA".

## Installing Git on Windows

## Using Git Bash
The command line interface is the preferred method to use github.  Unfortunately Windows doens't have a Bash terminal, 
so Git has included one in your Windows install.

## Rules for NOAA users
As NOAA users we are bound by a few rules:
* You can only contribute to NOAA affiliated repositories
* Collaborators outside of NOAA can not directly commit changes to NOAA repositories.  Instead they will have to go through pull requests.
* Project repositories should be backed up on a system inside the NOAA firewall (for example zip download the master to your local work computer).
